<h3><a id="about" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome!</h3>

<p>I would like to give you a quick introduction about myself and I hope it will help to explain you about my professional career.</p>

<p>I am a Computer Application Professional and serving in IT Industry from more than 10 years. My core expertise area is Web (Web/UI/Front-end) Development.</p>

<p>I have performed multiple roles like “Senior Software Engineer/Senior Web Developer/Senior Front-end Developer/Senior UI Developer/Team-Lead” during my professional career growth.</p>

<p>As we know that The Web World is changing and enhancing itself day-by-day so I created my 3C (Connect, Command and Contribute) to stay and serve in the Web Development. </p>
<p>
<strong>Connect: </strong>Create connection with the web technologies<br>
<strong>Command: </strong> Have the ability or mastery to use of web technologies<br>
<strong>Contribute: </strong> Give or support your values to web technologies</p>

<p>As an IT professional I always like to work with "Open Source Technologies" and I strongly feel that open source technologies developed for everyone to achieve their goals without any cost.</p>

<p>In my word I would like to define the 'Open Source Technologies' as 'Give and Take' World.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
