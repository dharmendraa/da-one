<p>I would like to give you a quick introduction about myself and I hope it will help me to explain you little bit about my professional carrier. </p>

<p>I am a Computer Application Professional and serving in IT Industry from more than 9 years. My core expertise area is UI/Front-end web development along with the Back-end web development. </p>

<p>I performed multiple roles like Web Developer/Sr. Web Developer/Sr. Front-end Developer/Sr. UI Developer/Team Lead during the professional carrier growth. </p>

<p>As an IT professional I like to work in Open Source Technologies and it is my strong feeling that Open Source Market it for everyone at any point of time and without any cost. In my word I define the Open Source Technologies is like "Give and Take" World. </p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
