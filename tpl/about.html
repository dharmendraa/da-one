<h3><a id="about" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome!</h3>

<p>I would like to give you a quick introduction about myself and I hope it will help to explain you about my professional carrier.</p>

<p>I am a Computer Application Professional and serving in IT Industry from more than 10 years. My core expertise area are Web/UI/Front-end web development along with the Back-end web development.</p>

<p>I have performed multiple roles like Web Developer/Sr. Web Developer/Sr. Front-end Developer/Sr. UI Developer/Team-Lead during my professional carrier growth. </p>

<p>As an IT professional I always like to work with "Open Source Technologies" and I strongly feel that open source technologies developed for everyone to achieve their goals without any cost.</p>

<p>In my word I would like to define the 'Open Source Technologies' as 'Give and Take' World.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
